# SJF Scheduling Sim
A Shortest-Job-First scheduler simulation in Haskell for teaching purposes

## Features
- Prints the order that jobs are run in, and at what time
- Prints the time that all jobs are completed
- Prints the total and average turnaround time for jobs

## Limitations
- Assumes there is always one valid job that can be run when the scheduler is called (to keep code simple for explanation purposes)
